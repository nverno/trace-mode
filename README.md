# Enhanced function tracing

This package provides a major-mode for viewing trace results generated with the
tracing functions from trace.el (eg. *trace-function*,
*trace-function-foreground*, *trace-function-background*).

The *trace-mode* provides highlighting, folding and font-locking to make
differentiating the output easier at a glance. It also defines movement commands
for structural navigation. Code folding support is provided for hideshow.el.
